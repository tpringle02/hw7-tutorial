    - **Mac and Linux**:
      - conda install -c fastai -y nbdev **OR** pip install nbdev
    - **Windows**:
      - pip install nbdev==2.3.7
3.  Install quarto
    - nvdev_install_quarto
      - Windows will redirect you to install it at the Quarto website

### Tutorial Steps

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Create a new repository and clone it to your computer
2.  Go to the terminal and make sure you’re in your repo’s directory
3.  Run `nbdev_new` to generate necessary files
4.  Replace `nbs/00_core.ipynb` and `nbs/index.ipynb` with the ones in
    this repository, and add `shampoo.csv` into the `nbs` folder
5.  Run `nbdev_readme` to generate a README.md that should look like
    this one
6.  Run `jupyter lab` in the repository
7.  Program `nbs/00_core.ipynb` such that everything works properly and
    save your PDF
8.  Run `nbdev_install_hooks`
9.  Push your changes to your Github
10. Go to your Github Settings, click `Deploy from a branch`, and select
    `gh-pages`.
11. Return to Github Code, click the gear on About, and set the website
    to Github Pages
12. Send the PDF and your Github Pages website to Alejandro and CC
    Prof. Poshyvanyk!

  - nbdev isn’t actually designed for Windows but this madlad somehow
    made it work anyways

P.S. I wrote this entire tutorial in one night.
